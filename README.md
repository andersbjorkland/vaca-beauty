# VACA Beauty 
## Overview
This is a showcase of my programming prowess for a position at Kreationsbyr√•n. This project is built in Silverstripe with the power of Bootstrap.


### Features
* The page contains an async pagination and display of products.
* You can sort products by newest or cheapest.
* A contact section will be displayed with default values. This can however be configured on the backend.


## Reflections
* Namespace seems not to be very intuitive with SilverStripe. I could not manage to add a route in `routes.yml` that pointed to `App\ArticlesController`. I resolved to make the controller without namespace.
* Returning Images as json required some debugging to do. I had to set `$owns`, then in the returning function I had to go into the product to get its image, upon which I got the URL.
* Sort on DBMoney causes me some trouble. I had to specify PriceAmount.
* Pagination with "start" as a query parameter is the array-start position of all items, not the page.
